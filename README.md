ClickOpotamus

Click + Hippopotamus = ClickOpotamus!

This project was born out of curiosity and a desire to learn. I wanted to explore an alternative to building GUIs with Python's tkinter, so I chose Windows Forms in C#. It all started with a simple goal: track the number of clicks I averaged while playing Dota 2. But instead of making it Dota-specific, I decided to generalize it.

Feel free to use, copy, or build upon this project—it's a fun little experiment that might just inspire your own.
Why I Made This

    To explore GUI development with Windows Forms in C#.
    To try a faster alternative to Python's tkinter.
    Because I love C# and wanted to learn more about it!

What I Learned

    Building GUIs with Windows Forms.
    Multithreading and how to manage threads in C#.
    File handling in C#—creating, reading, and writing JSON files.
    Translating concepts from other languages like JavaScript to C#.

This project helped me dive deeper into these concepts and see them in action.

Notes

    The application tracks clicks and saves data to a local JSON file.
    Ensure you have write permissions for the directory to store the JSON file.

Wrap-Up

This project was a fun experiment that turned into a useful tool for tracking click averages.
Whether you're a gamer, a developer, or just curious about Windows Forms.
